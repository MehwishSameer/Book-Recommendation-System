# Book-Recommendation-System
In this Project I have made two types of Book Recommendation System in python.

One is simple popularity based which recommends books depending on the book-ratings given by the users. The system recommends top 10 movies that are popular.

Another type implemented in this project is content based recommendation using TF-IDF technique of NLP. It generates the most relevant results to the user and recommends five movies with respect to movie user enters. This system provides different recommendation for all the movies whereas popularity recommendation system shows same result and differs only because of book-ratings.
